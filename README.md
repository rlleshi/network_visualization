# CoRG - Cognitive Reasoning #

Cognitive Computing is a branch of artificial intelligence, and this project aims at the construction of a cognitive computing system by modelling aspects of human reasoning like emotions and human interactions. For this, classical logical reasoning is extended with non-monotonic reasoning like defeasible logic and normative reasoning.Classical Logics like First Order Logic is a triple with Constants, Predicate and Functions.
This part of the project is to build a graph where the nodes represents Constants or Variables and the edges represent Predicates. This network graph can do various functionalities:
* Search for nodes
* Search for paths 
* Search for simialar nodes
